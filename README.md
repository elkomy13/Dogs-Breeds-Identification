# Dogs-Breeds-Identification

it is a comprehensive project where I developed a robust machine learning model to accurately classify and analyze images of dogs, identifying their breeds. The model, trained on a diverse dataset of 10,000+ labeled images encompassing 120 different dog breeds, now adeptly recognizes various breeds with high accuracy.

Key Achievements:

. Utilized Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 and Adam optimizer
. Hands-on experience in Google Colab, GPU optimization, and TensorBoard for performance analysis

Key Milestones:

. Data preparation and preprocessing
. Transfer learning with a pretrained model
. Model evaluation and optimization
. Saving and loading the trained model
. But the journey didn't stop there! During the process, I specialized in image preprocessing, turning images into tensors, and organized data into batches. Implemented callbacks, including TensorBoard for     
  tracking progress and Early Stopping to prevent overfitting.

Also, learned 10 ways to prevent overfitting:

1- Increase training dataset size
2- Data Augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming)
3- Dropout for neuron regularization
4- Weight Regularization (L1 or L2)
5- Early Stopping based on validation performance
6- Batch Normalization for stability
7- Ensemble Learning for diverse predictions
8- Cross-Validation for reliable performance estimates
9- Feature Selection to focus on informative features
10- Consider using a simpler model
