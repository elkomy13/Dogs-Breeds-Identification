# Dogs-Breeds-Identification

it is a comprehensive project where I developed a robust machine learning model to accurately classify and analyze images of dogs, identifying their breeds. The model, trained on a diverse dataset of 10,000+ labeled images encompassing 120 different dog breeds, now adeptly recognizes various breeds with high accuracy.

This project holds practical implications, serving as a valuable tool for veterinarians and pet owners to swiftly identify a dog's breed through images. Leveraging Transfer Learning, the MobileNetV2 model, and the Adam optimizer, I achieved significant milestones in deep learning.

Key Milestones:

1- Data preparation and preprocessing

2- Transfer learning with a pretrained model

3- Model evaluation and optimization

4- Saving and loading the trained model

This hands-on experience included setting up Google Colab, optimizing GPU utilization, and utilizing TensorBoard for insightful performance analysis
